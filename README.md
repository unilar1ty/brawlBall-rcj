Hi!

This is a repo documenting our Robocup Junior Open Soccer league team's progress as we start from nothing (as of writing) to making full fledged robots. 
I will be putting in many valuable resources that hopefully help you (if you're doing Open Soccer as well) on your journey as well.

enjoy! :)
